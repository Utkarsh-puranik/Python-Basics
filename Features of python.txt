Key Features of Python

Interpreted Language: Python does not require compilation, as it executes code line by line.

Dynamically Typed: No need to specify data types; Python automatically detects them.

Object-Oriented: Supports object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and objects.

Garbage Collection: Manages memory automatically, reducing memory leaks.

Multi-Paradigm: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.

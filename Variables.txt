A variable is a name given to a memory location that stores a value.
It acts as a container for data, allowing you to reference and manipulate the data. 
Variables do not need to be explicitly declared with a type in Python, which makes it a dynamically typed language.

Example:

x = 10  # Here, x is a variable storing the integer value 10
name = "John"  # name is a variable storing a string "John"


Variable Naming Rules:
-> Can include letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
-> The first character must be a letter or an underscore.
-> Python is case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
-> Cannot use Python reserved words (like class, False, if, etc.).
-> Assignment: In Python, you use the = operator to assign values to variables. The value can be of any type and can change during the program's execution.

Example:

age = 25  # integer variable
name = "Alice"  # string variable
is_valid = True  # boolean variable
